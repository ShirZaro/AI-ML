# AI-heuristic-search-algorithms
Implementation of heuristic search algorithms such as A*, hill climbing, simulated annealing, K Beam and genetic algorithm using Python.

THE PROBLEM:
you need to build a function that starts from one board and tries to reach another using only a chain of legal moves. We will use 6 Ã— 6 boards. @  indicates there is a forcefield there, blocking your advance and * indicates you have an agent in that location.
 Your agent can only move on straight lines (forward/back or
left/right) a distance of 1 each turn. A piece can disappear if it makes a move to go beyond the final (6th) line. The cost is the number of moves that is needed to reach the goal, so we
wish to minimize the number of steps that it will take to reach the goal board.
